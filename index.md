## About Me

Hi! My name is Ameer, I'm a recent graduate from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Mathematics. While at UW, I studied a wonderful mix of statistics, computer science and finance with a little physical science thrown in for fun. My experiences over the past few years have led me to develop a keen interest in computational statistics and machine learning. I have had the opportunity to partake in projects and extra curricular activities involving computer vision, text mining, venture capital, and predictive modelling with financial data. Keep reading to learn a little more about my academic and professional experiences.
