## About Me

Hi! My name is Ameer, I'm a recent graduate from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Mathematics. While at UW, I studied a wonderful mix of statistics, computer science and finance with a little physical science thrown in for fun. My experiences over the past few years have led me to develop a keen interest in computational statistics and machine learning. I have had the opportunity to partake in projects and extra curricular activities involving computer vision, text mining, venture capital, and predictive modelling with financial data. Keep reading to learn a little more about my academic and professional experiences.

## Projects

### CSEye

March 2018 - September 2018


### Gadsby Text Mining

September 2017 - June 2018

Having thoroughly enjoyed *STAT 442 - Data Visualization* in Fall 2016, I approached Professor Wayne Oldford upon returning to university the following Fall semester to work on a project together. After discussing interesting datasets available and thinking about what may be useful from a curriculum perspective, we settled on a text mining project. We decided to perform a decomposition of the book *Gadsby* by Ernest Vincent Wright. *Gadsby* is known as *A Story of Over 50,000 Words Without Using the Letter "E"*. This interesting quirk was the perfect starting point for analysis.

The [final report](./Gadsby_Project.html) discusses the process, findings, and learning outcomes of the Gadsby project.
